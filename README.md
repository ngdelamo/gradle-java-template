A gradle template for plain java projects.

In order to configure **IntelliJ IDEA** to use the code generated by annotation processing tools (i.e., *dagger2*), it is necessary to enable annotation processing:

- Go to `Settings…` → `Build, Execution, Deployment` → `Compiler` → `Annotation Processors`, check `Enable annotation processing` and `Obtain processors from project classpath`. To mimic the Gradle behavior and generated files behavior, you can configure the production and test sources directories to `build/generated/source/apt/main` and `build/generated/source/apt/test` respectively and choose to `Store generated sources relative to:` `Module content root`. See https://github.com/tbroyer/gradle-apt-plugin for more details.

You can deploy artifacts to your local maven repository using

```
$> ./gradlew uploadArchives
```

You can change the distribution group and/or version in the `variables.gradle` file (available 
through the *dist_group* and *dist_version* variables).
